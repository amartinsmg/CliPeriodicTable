# PeriodicTable

This is a personal project for a command line interface periodic table. It is made in C and uses a SQLite database to store elements' data.

The periodic table contains the chemical elements' data, like name, symbol, atomic number, atomic mass, density, melting point, and boiling point. It is useful in chemistry, physics, and other sciences.

To compile the program and create the SQLite3 database, you can use this command:
````
make
````

<sub>**Note**: Before compiling, make sure you have installed <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU C Compiler</a> (`gcc`) and <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite3</a>.</sub>
