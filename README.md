# PeriodicTable

This is a personal project for a CLI periodic table, made with C that uses a sqlite database to store elements data: name, symbol, atomic number, atomic mass, density, melting point and boiding point.

To create the sqlite3 database and compile the program, you can use this command:
````
make
````

<sub>**Note**: before compiling, make sure you have installed <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU C Compiler</a> (`gcc`) and <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">sqlite3</a>.</sub>
